# printersDatabase

Database of decorations, drop capitals, figures from differents books divided 
according to their printer.

## Antonomaz 

The `Antonomaz` contains about 300 files that correspond to the printers of the Antonomaz project. The encoding is minimal for now but it contains automatically enriched metadata (thanks to Idref).

## Production
Those files were producted thanks to a pipeline described in 
[extractor repo](https://github.com/e-ditiones/extractor).

Those files are produced according to TEI format, thanks to a specific ODD.
